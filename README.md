# canned-pouch-db ðŸ¥«

A trivial demonstration on how to can (ðŸ¥«) a pouchdb instance with a local node script and then load that pouchdb in an Ionic 5/Angular app.

See 'can-a-pouchdb.js' in the root directory to see how the local pouchdb instance is created and then serialized to src/assets/db.
See src/app/services/data.service.ts to see how to hydrate a new pouchDB with the canned database.

The data service uses the memory adapter so as to avoid having to destroy the database prior to every run.
